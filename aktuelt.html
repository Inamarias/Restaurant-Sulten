                    <h2>Sensibility of ordinary products becoming smart and 
                        connected </h2>
                    <p>Above, we seek to find out whether consumers find it sensible that more products, also 
                        regular products that previously were not smart or connected, now become so. There 
                        are still more respondents that find this to be a reasonable/sensible development (42%) 
                        compared to those that find it unreasonable/unsensible (30%). In addition, 25% answer 
                        either/or, while 3% are undecided.  
                        There is a slight gender difference, where 46% among men find this development

                        difference. The younger tend to find the increased tendency of dumb products 
                        becoming smart a reasonable thing, compared to the older generation (51% among 18-

                    <h2>Readiness to participate in a smart/connected world </h2>
                    <p>Finally, we wanted to know how well equipped Norwegian consumers feel in terms of 
                        participating in a world where things, homes and environments gradually become 
                        “smarter” and more connected to the internet. The question looks similar to the one in 
                        the previous chapter, but there we only asked people with IoT-things at home – and 
                        their present-day evaluation. Here, we ask all respondents and attempt to make them 
                        evaluate their future IoT-readiness.  
                        From the figure above, we see that most consumers feel well equipped to participate in 
                        an increasingly smart/connected society. Almost 6 out of 10 feel well/very well 
                        equipped, 23% moderately equipped, while 16% feel do not feel well equipped. Around 
                        3% are undecided.</p> 
                    <p>If we look at gender, there are some differences. A higher percentage among men 
                        (63%) than among women (53%) feel competent enough to participate in the IoT-
                        society. There are also 23% among men who feel “very well” equipped to paritcipate. 
                        For age, the differences are even more prominent. The sense of competence is 
                        reduced with increasing age; 79% among 18-29 years old feel well/very well equipped 
                        to participate in a smart/connected society, compared to 68% for the 30-39 years old, 
                        59% for the 40-49 years old, 52% for the 50-59 years old, and finally 38% for the 60-80 
                        years old. If we compare those that feel “very well” equipped, they account for 40% in 
                        the youngest group and only 4% in the oldest group. In the latter age group, 32% do 
                        not feel well equipped to participate in this development.</p>

             <div class="boxP3">
                    <h2>Primary drivers of the smart/connected development</h2>
                    <p>We often hear that new products supplied to the market are driven by consumer 
                        demand. We wanted to check with consumers themselves what they thought where the 
                        primary drivers of mass market IoT-products. From the figure above, we see that most 
                        consumers (60%) believe that this development is primarily driven by the industry. 
                        There are quite a few that state both consumer and the industry as primary drivers 
                        (30%), while only 6% see consumers as the primary drivers of this development.  
                        There are no gender differences here, but we see that age differentiates. While “only” 
                        45% of the youngest (18-29 years old) see the industry as the primary driver of 
                        development, as many as 71% among the oldest (60-80 years) claim the industry to be 
                        the primary driver. For the youngest group, there is a total of 48% that consider 
                        consumers to be somewhat involved in IoT development. This could be explained by a 
                        generational effect, as the younger generation are considered to be “digital natives”. 
                        They only have experience with a life that includes the social, participatory and 
                        collaborative internet (web 2.0 and web 3.0).
